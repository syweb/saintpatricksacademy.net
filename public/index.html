						<img src="images/bishop_fpo.jpg" alt="bishop" title="bishop" style="float:left; padding:0 10px 10px 0;"  />
						<p>The Saint Patrick SUCCEED Academy begins a new era of providing a Pre-K-8th Catholic education to the St. Rose, St. Anne, All Hallows, St. Peter, and Immaculate Conception parish communities in South Sacramento. Centrally located to these communities, the mission of the SUCCEED Academy is to offer an excellent Catholic education focused on the academic and spiritual formation of young people from Catholic families living in South Sacramento. An innovative governance model, expert leadership, upgraded facilities, academic rigor, enhanced programs, and substantial tuition assistance are all hallmarks of the new Saint Patrick SUCCEED Academy. I encourage you to give strong consideration to enrolling your child for the coming school year. A Catholic school education is one of the most valuable gifts that you can give to your child in his or her lifetime.</p>
						
						<p>+Jaime Soto <br />Bishop of Sacramento</p>
						<h3 class="title">A Word from the Principal</h3>
						<p>Dear Parents/Guardians.</p>
						<img src="images/laura-allen.jpg" alt="Laura Allen" title="Laura Allen" style="float:left; padding:0 10px 10px 0;" />
						<p>The success of our students depends upon the teamwork among their teachers, their parents/guardians, and themselves. As with any team, the coach is essential to leading the team to success . . . God, our coach, is ever present with us . . .it takes the prayer of our teachers, our parents/guardians, and our students to assist each child to recognize their many gifts and talents and allow them to realize their strengths so that every effort can be made to insure their future success.</p>
						<p>I am very happy to announce that we have three new staff members on our team.  Miss Maria Campos is working part time as an instructional assistant for grades 1-2.  Miss Campos is in the process of working toward her teaching credential.  Her quiet, but firm manner is providing our students with the additional support needed and our teachers are enjoying her assistance during the week.  Please welcome Ms. Lauren Whitfield to 
						our staff too.  Ms. Whitfield will be teaching our 7th and 8th grade language arts classes.  
						In an effort to reduce the class sizes of our language arts program, Ms. Whitfield will be teaching a section of the language arts program.  In addition, she will be providing additional language arts tutoring after school. Ms. Whitfield has much experience teaching in Catholic schools and is excited about being a part of our community.  Also new to our staff, is Sr. Mary Carton, IBVM.   Sr. Mary has extensive experience as a math teacher and a math coach for teachers.  She will be working with our students making sure that we are looking at every child’s math competencies and filling in whatever as well as challenging those students needing additional math enrichment to accelerate their learning.  Sr. Mary will be starting an after school math club and will assist us with our Academic Decathlon team.  We are grateful that Sr. Mary has agreed to become a member of our wonderful community. </p>
						<p>Please continue to pray for all those people who are so involved with making St. Patrick SUCCEED Academy such a success!  </p>
						<p>We have so many people providing financial assistance to us each month to make the continuance of the wonderful programs we have a reality.  We are blessed to have them in our lives!</p>
						<p>Sincerely,<br/>Laura Allen, Principal</p>
						
						
						
						<h3 class="title">Vision Statement</h3>
						<p>St. Patrick SUCCEED Academy will provide a gateway into 21st century learning  by providing students with the tools to succeed as faith-filled, community-focused and self-motivated learners prepared to meet the needs of a diverse and changing world.</p>
						
						<h3 class="title">Mission Statement</h3>
						<p>St. Patrick SUCCEED Academy, a culturally diverse diocesan regional school, serves students in the South Sacramento area and the surrounding communities.  The ministry of the Academy is threefold:  to provide a positive, Christ-centered, 21st century learning experience through excellence in academics; to be attentive to all aspects of the individual child's development; and to provide students with the tools to be self-motivated critical thinkers.  The modeling and practice of moral and ethical values, coupled with the teachings of our Catholic faith, further empower our students to meet all future challenges.  Aiding parents in their responsibility as the primary educators of their children, the Academy strives to honor and celebrate our ethnic and spiritual diversity while preparing our students to be bearers of compassion, respect and knowledge to the larger world.</p>

						<h3 class="title">A mission to help every child succeed</h3>
						
						<p>“Your child’s readiness for the 21st century — for jobs we don’t even know about yet — starts with discovering who they are. That’s when they become excited about math, science, technology, literature, art, sports or music — all the programs Saint Patrick SUCCEED Academy offers to prepare young minds for college-prep high school. Share with me your dreams for your kids so I can build a school with your input.”
