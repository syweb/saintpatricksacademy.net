							<h3 class="title">July 2010</h3>
  						<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
  						<p>Thank you so much for registering your child(ren) for the 2010-2011 school year at St. Patrick SUCCEED Academy. Bishop Soto, our Executive Board and I are very excited about the upcoming year and the future of our new regional school. Major renovations are occurring to the building as our science lab, computer lab, art and music studios, and our large library are being built. These facilities will provide your child(ren) with the most up- to-date learning environment possible and for that I’m very grateful.</p>

  						<p>As you know, a school community is more than the buildings; it is about the family-centered community that transcends the students, staff, and families. It is about the God-centered environment that we all believe is so necessary to build the foundation for our students so as they begin to experience the world, God is ever-present in their lives. It is this type of community that I have experienced in the past and it is the community that I have high hopes for the future. It is the community that together we shall build that will bring about the traditions for the future.</p>
  						<p>Many of you have heard the recent news regarding St. Francis Elementary School. This last spring, St. Francis School asked to have its 90 year old building evaluated to make sure it was earthquake safe for their students and staff. Knowing that the building was built in 1923, they were pretty sure that there would be some issues for the parish community to address, however they had no idea that the results of the evaluation would be so massive. Upon receiving the results in June, it was determined that the community would not be able to safely house the school for the upcoming school year. Upon looking at a variety of possibilities for a temporary building, it was determined that they would move to the All Hallows site. It is important for us to understand that St. Francis School is filled to capacity. It is financially sound and its future looks extremely bright, except for the fact that their building has created a temporary detour for them at this time.</p>
  						<p>I know that you will join me in praying for the St. Francis School community during this difficult time of transition. Not only have they been temporarily removed from their current site, but they must come up with some future options to determine if it will be feasible to raise the several million dollars that it will take to renovate their school. As stated earlier, a school community is more than the buildings themselves; it is about the community it creates. Please pray for their community as they prepare for this transition.</p>
  						<p>Our staff members are very busy organizing, painting, cleaning, and planning for a wonderful new school year. They are extremely excited about our future and all the possibilities that are in store for our students and their families. Meetings are taking place several times each week with our staff as we plan our School wide Learning Expectations, discuss our mission and work to create a cohesive curriculum for your child(ren).</p>
  						<p>Currently, our enrollment is very strong. We do, however, have a few openings in several classes. If you know of someone that has not registered, please ask them to call our school office. We will be happy to assist them. Please be sure to contact either Pablo Salazar or myself should you have any questions. Our school office is open throughout the summer and is currently located in the first grade classroom while the construction is taking place. Call first, but we would love to have you come by and see all the exciting things that are happening on our campus.</p>
  						<p>I have enclosed a <a href="images/supplies-list.pdf">school supply list</a> for you in hopes that you will be able to take advantage of all the Back to School sales that will be advertised in the coming weeks. Please be sure that your child has as much as possible from the list on the first day of school. If you are in need of some assistance with the list, please contact the school office. We have some donations that may be available late in August should you need them.</p>
  						<p>Please note the following important dates for the remainder of the summer:</p>
  						<div class="bullet-list2">
  							<ul>
  								<li>Friday, July 30th	from 5:00 -8:00 - second uniform try on day; please drive around to the back of the school and park on the basketball courts inside the fence. We will be next to the gym.</li>
  								<li>Week of August 9th –help is needed with weeding and planting throughout the campus. If you would like to get a head start on your parent hours, this would be a great opportunity! Please call the school office and let us know that you are available to work.</li>
  								<li>Friday, August 20th – 5:30 – 8:00 Family Potluck. Join us for an evening of fun and activity! This is a great opportunity to get to know one another, take a tour of our campus, let the kids play together, and share a meal with one another. If your family will be attending, please either e-mail Mrs. Ugarte at <a href="mailto:cugarte@saintpatricks.net">cugarte@saintpatricks.net</a> or return the <a href="images/family-potluck.pdf">enclosed form</a> to school.</li>
  								<li>Monday, August 30th – First Day of School: 12:15 dismissal that day. As of today, we are on schedule to be able to open our doors as planned. Should there be a delay with the construction, I will let you know as soon as I am aware of a delay.</li>

  							</ul>
  						</div>
  						<p>I look forward to seeing all of you at our Family Potluck on August 20th and as we begin this new adventure as we create our new regional Catholic school. Please continue to keep one another, our staff, our construction workers, and the St. Francis School community in your prayers. With God all things are possible!</p>
  						<p>With much gratitude and peace to each of you,</p>
  						<p>Sincerely,</p>
  						<p>Laura Allen, Principal</p>

  				
						
						
						<h3 class="title">February 2010</h3>
						<p>Many thanks to those of you who have met with me in the last few weeks to share your hopes and dreams for your child’s Catholic education. We are well on the way to making sure that many of those dreams come true! </p>
						<p>Over the last few weeks, I went into the classrooms of Saint Patrick’s and John Paul II Schools.  I was very impressed by the student’s honesty and willingness to share their hopes and dreams for their school.  Our new school will focus on the needs of the children. Who better to listen to when creating our mission and philosophy? </p>
						<p>As Saint Patrick’s SUCCEED Academy is the Bishop’s regional school, I am very excited about creating the environment many of you have talked about. Bishop Jamie Soto is dedicated to our success. Funding is in place to renovate the campus and upgrade the infrastructure to meet the technological needs of our children. Financial assistance is available for families committed to, yet unable to afford, providing their children with the experiences of a Catholic education.</p>
						<p>I  encourage you to make note of the  important opportunities and deadlines on our school <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>. As I write this, information about curriculum, faculty and campus renovations are being prepared for our next update. </p>
						<p>If you, family members or friends have questions, please call the school office or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:lallen@saintpatricksacademy.net">lallen@saintpatricksacademy.net</a>. I look forward to sharing more news with you soon.</p>

						<h3 class="title">A mission to help every child succeed</h3>
						<p>“Your child’s readiness for the 21st century — for jobs we don’t even know about yet — starts with discovering who they are. That’s when they become excited about math, science, technology, literature, art, sports or music — all the programs Saint Patrick SUCCEED Academy offers to prepare young minds for college-prep high school. Share with me your dreams for your kids so I can build a school with your input.”
